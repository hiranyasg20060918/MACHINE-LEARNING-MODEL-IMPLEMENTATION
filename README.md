>> Project Overview

This project demonstrates machine learning with Python by classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the famous Iris dataset, the project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to train a model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new samples. This hands-on task highlights the fundamentals of ML, dataset handling, model training, evaluation, and custom prediction using Python.


>> Objectives

Load and explore the Iris dataset using Pandas
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
Evaluate the model using accuracy score and classification report
Predict the species of custom input flowers
Understand the workflow of a basic machine learning pipeline


>> Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

IDE: IDLE


>> Process

1. Dataset Loading – The Iris dataset is loaded from Scikit-Learn and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy exploration.

2. Data Exploration – Basic inspection of the dataset includes checking features, targets, and sample data.

3. Data Splitting – Dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.

4. Model Training – A KNN classifier (k=3) is trained on the training set.

5. Evaluation – The trained model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy score and classification report, providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

6. Custom Prediction – Users can input a custom flower’s features to predict its species using the trained model.
